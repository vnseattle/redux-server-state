# Redux-Server-State
This demonstration showcases a common project exampleâ€”an interactive todo list. Within this todo list, we illustrate the process of sending a request to a database (specifically, using JSON Server) and seamlessly converting it into a Redux state with just a single line of code.

Furthermore, we provide various scenarios in which you may desire to modify the Redux states once you have obtained the data within them.

# Usage
To run this app, you need to start the JSON server first. By default, the API runs on port 3000, while the app itself runs on port 3001. Therefore, ensure that you run the API before launching the app.

```js
npm i
```

```js
npm run start
```
